Capstone Project
Section A -- Problem 5
Team Symplifyers

In this project we were asked to create a folder cleaner. We have implemented various functions such as 
checking whether file is empty, deleting the files older than a certain date, deleting the file less than
the specified number of times the file has been accessed, and printing the memory saved after removing the
unwanted files. 

We have also implemented the function to display the details of the folder.
